## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Nofitfications page component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

-   Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
-   Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Intro

Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl) challenge. ðŸ˜€

Feel free to look around and explore! ðŸ˜‰

## Overview

For this challenge, I used...

-   React
-   Tailwind css

## Things I Learned

This was my first time using all of these libraries/packages (besides React), so I learned a lot! Besides learning those new tools, I realized how important it is to stay organized and write code that is clean and reusable, especially as the project you're working on grows larger. ðŸ™‚

## Things I Wish I Would Have Done

-   Probably thought a little bit more about how to structure my styles before I started
